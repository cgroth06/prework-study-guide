# Chris Groth's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I am embarking on a journey to develop my coding abilities, specifically HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
- Along this journey, I want to develop methodological practices to ensure success. Documenting the skills and knowledge I learn in a website will be good practice, and will also serve as a reference. 
- Over the course of developing these skills, I will manage an abundance of information. This website is an effort to organize this knowledge base all the while practicing the skills at hand.
- Developing this website incoroporated skills in Terminal, VScode, HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, README, and deployment. Beginning in HTML, an outline for the study guide was developed. Through the development of a CSS I was able to make the layout of the page more UX friendly. Practicing a git flow, I was able to initiate branches for updating the website. In an effort to make the website more interactive, I deployed JavaScript to implement a random "subject to study" generator.
